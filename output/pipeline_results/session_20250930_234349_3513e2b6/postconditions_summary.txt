======================================================================

Function: bubbleSort
======================================================================

Postcondition 1:
  Formal: ∀i,j: 0 ≤ i < j < size → arr[i] ≤ arr[j]
  Natural: Array is sorted in ascending order
  Translation: For every pair of indices i and j in the range from 0 to the size of the array, the element at index i is less than or equal to the element at index j.
  Reasoning: This condition ensures that the array is sorted in ascending order, which is the fundamental property of a sorted array. It verifies that the bubble sort algorithm has correctly sorted the array.
  Edge cases: 4
    - Empty array (size=0): trivially true
    - Single element: no pairs
    - NULL pointer: function should handle
  Quality: 0.91
  Robustness: 0.92
