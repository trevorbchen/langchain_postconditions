Function: reverseList
======================================================================

Postcondition 1:
  Formal: ∀i: 0 ≤ i < size → list[i] = list[size - i - 1]
  Natural: Array elements are reversed in order
  Translation: For every index i from 0 to size-1, the element at position i in the list equals the element at position (size - i - 1) in the original list. This means the first element becomes last, second becomes second-to-last, and so on.
  Reasoning: This ensures the complete reversal property - every element swaps to its mirror position. It prevents partial reversals or incorrect index calculations that could leave some elements in wrong positions.
  Edge cases: 5
    - Empty list (size=0): no elements to reverse, trivially true
    - Single element list (size=1): element stays in same position (i=0, size-i-1=0)
    - Two elements: properly swaps positions (i=0→1, i=1→0)
  Quality: 0.92
  Robustness: 0.91
