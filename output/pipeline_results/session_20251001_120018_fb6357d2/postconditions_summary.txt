======================================================================

Function: sort_numbers
======================================================================

Postcondition 1:
  Formal: ∀i,j: 0 ≤ i < j < size → numbers[i] ≤ numbers[j]
  Natural: Array is sorted in ascending order
  Translation: For every pair of indices i and j in the range from 0 to the size of the array, where i comes before j, the element at index i must be less than or equal to the element at index j. This ensures complete ordering of all elements.
  Reasoning: This is the fundamental correctness property for sorting. It prevents out-of-order elements which would break algorithms depending on sorted data like binary search. Without this guarantee, the function would not be a valid sort.
  Edge cases: 6
    - Empty array (size=0): universal quantification over empty set is vacuously true
    - Single element (size=1): no pairs exist where i < j, trivially sorted
    - Duplicate elements: uses ≤ operator to allow equal adjacent elements
  Quality: 0.92
  Robustness: 0.92

Postcondition 2:
  Formal: numbers ≠ NULL
  Natural: The input pointer is not NULL
  Translation: The input pointer to the array of numbers is not NULL. This ensures that we are not trying to sort an array that does not exist.
  Reasoning: This is essential for avoiding segmentation faults and undefined behavior. If the input pointer is NULL, the function will try to access memory that it shouldn't, leading to crashes or incorrect results.
  Edge cases: 2
    - NULL pointer: function does not attempt to sort non-existent array
    - Empty array (size=0): still valid as long as pointer is not NULL
  Quality: 0.89
  Robustness: 0.88

Postcondition 3:
  Formal: ∀i: 0 ≤ i < size → numbers'[i] = numbers[i]
  Natural: All elements in the original array are in the sorted array
  Translation: For every index i from 0 to size-1, the element at position i in the sorted array equals some element in the original array. This ensures that no elements are lost or added during sorting.
  Reasoning: This ensures data preservation. It prevents bugs where elements are lost or added during sorting, which would result in incorrect results.
  Edge cases: 3
    - Empty array (size=0): no elements to preserve, trivially true
    - Single element (size=1): element stays in same position (i=0, size-i-1=0)
    - Duplicate elements: all duplicates must be preserved
  Quality: 0.92
  Robustness: 0.91

Postcondition 4:
  Formal: size ≥ 0
  Natural: The size of the array is non-negative
  Translation: The size of the array is greater than or equal to zero. This ensures that we are not trying to sort an array with a negative size, which is not possible.
  Reasoning: This is essential for avoiding undefined behavior and crashes. If the size is negative, the function will try to access memory that it shouldn't, leading to crashes or incorrect results.
  Edge cases: 2
    - Negative size: function does not attempt to sort non-existent elements
    - Empty array (size=0): still valid as long as size is non-negative
  Quality: 0.89
  Robustness: 0.88

Postcondition 5:
  Formal: ∀i: 0 ≤ i < size → numbers[i] ∈ Z
  Natural: All elements in the array are integers
  Translation: For every index i from 0 to size-1, the element at position i in the array is an integer. This ensures that we are not trying to sort non-integer elements, which is not supported by this function.
  Reasoning: This is essential for ensuring that the function operates correctly. If the array contains non-integer elements, the function may produce incorrect results or crash.
  Edge cases: 2
    - Non-integer elements: function does not attempt to sort unsupported types
    - Empty array (size=0): no elements to check, trivially true
  Quality: 0.89
  Robustness: 0.88

Postcondition 6:
  Formal: size ≤ MAX_INT
  Natural: The size of the array is within the integer limit
  Translation: The size of the array is less than or equal to the maximum integer limit. This ensures that we are not trying to sort an array that is too large, which could lead to overflow errors or crashes.
  Reasoning: This is essential for avoiding overflow errors and crashes. If the size is too large, the function may overflow its index variables, leading to incorrect results or crashes.
  Edge cases: 2
    - Size equal to MAX_INT: function can handle largest possible array
    - Size larger than MAX_INT: function does not attempt to sort oversized array
  Quality: 0.89
  Robustness: 0.88
