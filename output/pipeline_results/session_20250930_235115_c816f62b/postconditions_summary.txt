======================================================================

Function: reverseArray
======================================================================

Postcondition 1:
  Formal: ∀i: 0 ≤ i < size → arr[i] = arr[size - i - 1]
  Natural: Array is reversed
  Translation: For every index i in the range 0 to size, the element at index i after execution is equal to the element at index (size - i - 1) before execution.
  Reasoning: This ensures that the array is reversed in place, which is the primary functionality of the function. It guarantees that each element at index i swaps places with the element at the corresponding index from the end of the array.
  Edge cases: 3
    - Empty array (size=0): trivially true
    - Single element: no change
    - NULL pointer: undefined behavior
  Quality: 0.91
  Robustness: 0.92
