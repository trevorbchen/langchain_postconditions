======================================================================

Function: sort_array
======================================================================

Postcondition 1:
  Formal: ∀i,j: 0 ≤ i < j < size → arr[i] ≤ arr[j]
  Natural: Array is sorted in non-decreasing order
  Translation: For every pair of indices i and j where i comes before j, the element at position i is less than or equal to the element at position j
  Reasoning: This ensures the fundamental sorting property holds for all adjacent and non-adjacent pairs, preventing any out-of-order elements
  Edge cases: 3
    - Empty array (size=0): vacuously true
    - Single element (size=1): no pairs to compare
    - Duplicates: arr[i] = arr[j] handled correctly
  Quality: 0.93
  Robustness: 0.92

Postcondition 2:
  Formal: ∀i: 0 ≤ i < size → arr[i] ∈ original_arr
  Natural: All elements in the sorted array are from the original array
  Translation: For every index i, the element at position i in the sorted array is an element of the original array
  Reasoning: This ensures that no new elements are introduced during the sorting process
  Edge cases: 3
    - Empty array (size=0): vacuously true
    - Single element (size=1): only one element to check
    - Duplicates: handled correctly as they exist in the original array
  Quality: 0.91
  Robustness: 0.90

Postcondition 3:
  Formal: ∀i: 0 ≤ i < size → count(arr[i]) = count(original_arr[i])
  Natural: The count of each element in the sorted array is the same as in the original array
  Translation: For every index i, the number of occurrences of the element at position i in the sorted array is equal to the number of occurrences of the same element in the original array
  Reasoning: This ensures that no elements are lost or duplicated during the sorting process
  Edge cases: 3
    - Empty array (size=0): vacuously true
    - Single element (size=1): only one element to count
    - Duplicates: handled correctly as their counts should remain the same
  Quality: 0.91
  Robustness: 0.90

Postcondition 4:
  Formal: arr ≠ NULL ∧ size ≥ 0
  Natural: The array is not NULL and the size is non-negative
  Translation: The array pointer is not NULL and the size of the array is greater than or equal to zero
  Reasoning: This ensures that the function does not operate on invalid data
  Edge cases: 2
    - Empty array (size=0): handled correctly as size is non-negative
    - NULL pointer: handled correctly as the array is not NULL
  Quality: 0.93
  Robustness: 0.95

Postcondition 5:
  Formal: ∃t: t ≥ 0 ∧ t ≤ O(n log n)
  Natural: The time complexity of the function is between 0 and O(n log n)
  Translation: There exists a time t such that t is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to O(n log n)
  Reasoning: This ensures that the function has a reasonable time complexity
  Edge cases: 2
    - Empty array (size=0): handled correctly as time complexity is non-negative
    - Single element (size=1): handled correctly as time complexity is less than or equal to O(n log n)
  Quality: 0.86
  Robustness: 0.85
