======================================================================

Function: sort_array_descending
======================================================================

Postcondition 1:
  Formal: ∀i,j: 0 ≤ i < j < size → arr[i] ≥ arr[j]
  Natural: Array is sorted in non-increasing order
  Translation: For every pair of indices i and j where i comes before j, the element at position i is greater than or equal to the element at position j
  Reasoning: This ensures the fundamental sorting property holds for all adjacent and non-adjacent pairs, preventing any out-of-order elements
  Edge cases: 3
    - Empty array (size=0): vacuously true
    - Single element (size=1): no pairs to compare
    - Duplicates: arr[i] = arr[j] handled correctly
  Quality: 0.93
  Robustness: 0.92

Postcondition 2:
  Formal: arr ≠ NULL
  Natural: Array pointer is not NULL
  Translation: The pointer to the array is not NULL
  Reasoning: This ensures that the function does not attempt to sort a non-existent array, which would lead to undefined behavior
  Edge cases: 1
    - NULL pointer: arr = NULL leads to undefined behavior
  Quality: 0.99
  Robustness: 0.99

Postcondition 3:
  Formal: size ≥ 0
  Natural: Size of array is non-negative
  Translation: The size of the array is greater than or equal to zero
  Reasoning: This ensures that the function does not attempt to sort an array with a negative size, which would lead to undefined behavior
  Edge cases: 1
    - Negative size: size < 0 leads to undefined behavior
  Quality: 0.99
  Robustness: 0.99
