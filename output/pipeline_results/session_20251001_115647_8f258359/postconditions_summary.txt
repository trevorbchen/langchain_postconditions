======================================================================

Function: reverseList
======================================================================

Postcondition 1:
  Formal: ∀i: 0 ≤ i < size → list[i] = list[size - i - 1]
  Natural: Array elements are reversed in order
  Translation: For every index i from 0 to size-1, the element at position i in the list equals the element at position (size - i - 1) in the list after the function call. This means the first element becomes last, second becomes second-to-last, and so on.
  Reasoning: This ensures the complete reversal property - every element swaps to its mirror position. It prevents partial reversals or incorrect index calculations that could leave some elements in wrong positions.
  Edge cases: 5
    - Empty list (size=0): no elements to reverse, trivially true
    - Single element (size=1): element stays in same position (i=0, size-i-1=0)
    - Two elements: properly swaps positions (i=0→1, i=1→0)
  Quality: 0.92
  Robustness: 0.91

Postcondition 2:
  Formal: ∀i: 0 ≤ i < size → list[i] ≠ NULL
  Natural: No element in the list is NULL
  Translation: For every index i from 0 to size-1, the element at position i in the list is not NULL. This ensures that all elements in the list are valid integers.
  Reasoning: This prevents NULL pointer dereference errors which can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
  Edge cases: 3
    - List with NULL elements: ensures NULL elements are not allowed
    - Empty list (size=0): trivially true as there are no elements
    - Single element (size=1): ensures single element is not NULL
  Quality: 0.89
  Robustness: 0.90

Postcondition 3:
  Formal: list ≠ NULL
  Natural: The list pointer is not NULL
  Translation: The pointer to the list is not NULL. This ensures that the list exists in memory and can be accessed and modified.
  Reasoning: This prevents NULL pointer dereference errors which can lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
  Edge cases: 1
    - NULL pointer for list: ensures list exists in memory
  Quality: 0.89
  Robustness: 0.90
