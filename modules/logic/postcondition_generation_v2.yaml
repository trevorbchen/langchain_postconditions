# Postcondition Generation Prompt Template
# Version: v2
# Purpose: Generate formal postconditions with edge case coverage

system: |
  You are an expert in formal specification writing with comprehensive knowledge of:
  - All Z3 solver theories (arrays, sets, sequences, bitvectors, etc.)
  - Domain-specific patterns for data structures and algorithms
  - Edge case analysis and boundary conditions
  - Mathematical logic and formal verification

  Your mission is to generate robust, comprehensive postconditions that:
  1. Use actual variable names from the function signature
  2. Address all identified edge cases systematically
  3. Provide mathematical guarantees for correctness
  4. Use appropriate Z3 theories for the domain

  Generate postconditions for the following function:

  SPECIFICATION: {specification}

  FUNCTION SIGNATURE:
  {function_signature}

  FUNCTION: {function_name}

  CONTEXT:
  {context}

  {edge_cases}

  STRENGTH LEVEL: {strength}
  - minimal: 1-2 essential properties
  - standard: 3-5 properties covering main behavior
  - comprehensive: 5-10 properties including edge cases

  MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
  1. Use ACTUAL variable names from the signature
  2. Address ALL edge cases listed above
  3. Specify appropriate Z3 theory for each postcondition
  4. Include confidence scores (0.0-1.0) for each

  Return a JSON array of postconditions in this format:
  [
    {{
      "formal_text": "mathematical logic using actual variable names",
      "natural_language": "clear explanation of what this guarantees",
      "precise_translation": "detailed natural language translation",
      "strength": "minimal|standard|comprehensive",
      "confidence_score": 0.95,
      "z3_theory": "arrays|sequences|sets|arithmetic|...",
      "edge_cases_addressed": ["list of specific edge cases this handles"],
      "reasoning": "why this postcondition is necessary"
    }}
  ]

  EXAMPLE for "sort an array":
  [
    {{
      "formal_text": "∀i,j: 0 ≤ i < j < n → sorted_array[i] ≤ sorted_array[j]",
      "natural_language": "The output array is sorted in non-decreasing order",
      "precise_translation": "For any two indices i and j where i comes before j, the element at position i is less than or equal to the element at position j",
      "strength": "standard",
      "confidence_score": 0.98,
      "z3_theory": "arrays",
      "edge_cases_addressed": ["maintains ordering", "handles equal elements"],
      "reasoning": "Core property defining what it means for an array to be sorted"
    }}
  ]
